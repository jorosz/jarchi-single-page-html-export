# An Opinionated Single-page HTML Export for jArchi and Archi

\*Customized version of the fantastic HTML export tool for jArchi. This is a
major rewrite that produces a very opinionated export of a very opinionated
Archimate model into a single HTML page.

It can be used to export models that highlight applications, application flows
(interfaces) and application functions in order to support a high level
conceptual application design.

The scripts exports all views from the selected folder alongside the views
diagram, and generates documentation for each view.

### Export content

The meta-model for the export is very opinionated and therefore only a selected
number of Archimate concepts are being used and exported:

- Applications and modules shall be represented as Application Component
  concepts.
- Flow relationships represent data exchanges (i.e. interfaces) amongst those
  components.
- Application Functions concepts (bound to Application Components via
  Realization Relationship) represent the functionality that will be
  represented.

The export creates a table with all applications, their realized functions and
their flows for each view.

### Other notable changes:

- single page view (no tabs)
- CSS handling logic sanitized, it's in a separate file so it can be linted
- simplified (?) visibility rule creation
- CSS variables replaced the parameters. it's 2026!
- TODO: all tree and navigation with show/hide logic simplified to a single navigation using anchors
  to allow printing and export. also support for a single view should be added
- the original script implements a hiding logic where each concept in a table row is listed once and
  the shown or hidden depending on view. my version produces the tables for each view, potentially
  duplicating the content. it results in a cleaner code in my opinion at the cost of a slightly
  bigger HTML result.
- removed markdown checkbox (it's on and that's it. it's 2026, nothing markdown does that should not
  be done in terms of documenting stuff)
- marked is customized to ignore headers and render them as a bold paragraph 
- all views from all sub folders get included. however, the tree view does not
  show folders, only the views are being listed, folders are being skipped. This
  is for user simplicity.
- changed the logic of managing views: the tabs are gone and everything gets
  rendered on one page
